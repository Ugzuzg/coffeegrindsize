The build_tools directory contains scripts used for building Mac and
Windows executables and packaging them in installers.

This was contributed by Chris Satterlee, and questions may be directed
to me at csatt1@gmail.com. This workflow was developed for my open
source project https://github.com/csatt/IV_Swinger so it was pretty easy
to port it to coffeegrindsize.

Do NOT use this directory for running these tools. If you do that, then
the output files might accidently get committed to the repo, and that is
not what we want.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions for Mac build:

  1) Install pyinstaller:

       % pip install pyinstaller

     If you already have pyinstaller installed, make sure you upgrade to
     the current version. Fixes for Issues 3820 and 5175 are required. I
     believe that 4.1 or higher is ok.

  2) Install dmgbuild:

       % pip install dmgbuild
       % pip install biplist

  3) Set environment variable $GITHUB to point to the parent directory
     of your clone of the coffeegrindsize GitHub repo, e.g.:

       % export GITHUB="$HOME/GitHub"

     Or to make it permanent (assuming you use bash):

       % echo 'export GITHUB="$HOME/GitHub"' >> ~/.bash_profile

  4) Update the version string in $GITHUB/coffeegrindsize/build_tools/version.txt

  5) Complete all testing using straight Python (this assumes that
     you have installed all of the required Python packages):

       % cd $GITHUB/coffeegrindsize
       % python coffeegrindsize.py

  6) Create a build folder/directory somewhere NOT under $GITHUB, e.g.:

       % mkdir $HOME/coffeegrindsize_build

  7) Run pyinstaller script in the build folder:

       % cd $HOME/coffeegrindsize_build
       % $GITHUB/coffeegrindsize/build_tools/mac_run_pyi

     NOTE: Unfortunately, this generates many scary, but harmless
           warnings. As long as the next step works, you're ok

  8) Test the generated executable:

       % cd $HOME/coffeegrindsize_build
       % open dist/coffeegrindsize.app

  9) Build the DMG with dmgbuild:

       % cd $HOME/coffeegrindsize_build
       % $GITHUB/coffeegrindsize/build_tools/mac_build_dmg

 10) Test the DMG:

       % open *.dmg

       Follow instructions to install

 11) Test the installed app by launching from Applications folder

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions for Windows build:

NOTE: it is assumed that you already have python and pip installed as
      well as all of the python packages required to run coffeegrindsize.py
      using straight Python

  1) Install WiX, pyinstaller, BeautifulSoup4, and lxml:

       http://wixtoolset.org/releases/ (install latest)
         -> add %WIX%bin to your %path%
       pip install pyinstaller
       pip install beautifulsoup4
       pip install lxml

  2) Set environment variable %GITHUB% to point to the parent directory
     of your clone of the coffeegrindsize GitHub repo, e.g.:

       set GITHUB=%HOME%\Documents\GitHub
       setx GITHUB %HOME%\Documents\GitHub

  3) Update the version string in %GITHUB%\coffeegrindsize\build_tools\version.txt

  4) Complete all testing using straight Python:

       cd %GITHUB%\coffeegrindsize
       python coffeegrindsize.py

  5) Create a build folder/directory somewhere NOT under %GITHUB%, e.g.:

       mkdir %HOME%\coffeegrindsize_build

  6) Run the run_pyi.bat script in that folder:

       cd %HOME%\coffeegrindsize_build
       %GITHUB%\coffeegrindsize\build_tools\run_pyi.bat

     NOTE: Unfortunately, this generates many scary, but harmless
           warnings. As long as the next step works, you're ok

  7) Test the generated executable:

       cd %HOME%\coffeegrindsize_build
       dist\coffeegrindsize\coffeegrindsize.exe

  8) Run the WiX "heat" utility like this:

       cd %HOME%\coffeegrindsize_build
       heat dir dist\coffeegrindsize -ag -sfrag -sreg -template product -out heat.wxs

       Now you have a file %HOME%\coffeegrindsize_build\heat.wxs

  9) Run the fix_heat_wxs.py script:

       python %GITHUB%\coffeegrindsize\build_tools\fix_heat_wxs.py heat.wxs

 10) Run candle (WiX tool):

       candle coffeegrindsize_*.wxs

 11) Run light (WiX tool):

       light -b dist\coffeegrindsize -sice:ICE60 coffeegrindsize_*.wixobj

 12) Test the installer:

       msiexec /i coffeegrindsize_*.msi /l*v coffeegrindsize.log
     OR
       Find it with Windows Explorer and double-click it

 13) Test the installed app by launching from the Start Menu
